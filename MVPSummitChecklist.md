## Pre-Travel
1. Backup your mobile phone if you are not auto-syncing to the cloud.
1. Clear space on your phone or add extra memory if you know you will take lots of photos and videos.
1. Update your contacts. Make sure you know how to contact your MVP friends while at the summit. This includes apps like Skype, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.
1. Back up your laptop and install any pending updates. You do not want to have to do this over summit or hotel wi-fi.
1. Download books, films, music or audio to your phone, tablet or laptop for the flight(s). Add music you can fall asleep to when taking a long flight.
1. Download the airline's mobile app (if applicable) so you can watch movies during the flight.
1. Download maps of the Seattle/Redmond area so you can navigate the city.
1. Add a roaming package to your phone (if applicable).
1. Confirm your MVP profile has your correct social network information. Also, make sure your contributions are current.
1. Reach out to MVPs and Microsoft people you want to connect with while at the summit. Set up times before heading to Seattle so you can meet up between sessions or after hours.
1. Photocopy/scan your passport identification page and ID. Leave copies with family or friends in case you need to replace them.
1. Arrange for travel health insurance and take care of health needs, such as prescriptions and vaccinations, required to enter the USA.
1. Tell your credit card company you’ll be travelling abroad.
1. Note your MVP number as you may need it for registration.
1. If you are an MCP, note your MCP ID and make sure you can access your MCP transcript. In past years, the people running the MCP program had special gifts for those who could provide their transcript.

## Packing
1. Most events are casual (think hoodies and jeans).
1. You will most likely get SWAG from your product group and/or buy items at the Microsoft company store. This means you can pack less in your suitcase and wear some of these new clothes.
1. If you plan on buying a lot, leave space in your suitcase for the new items. But remember your airline's weight restrictions.
1. Put your name on any MVP gear you are bringing. When everyone is wearing the same clothing, MVP gear can get mixed up and lost.
1. Bring earplugs and a sleep mask if you are sharing a room and a light sleeps. Just because you want to sleep does not mean your roommate does.
1. Bring a laptop so you can take notes and participate in labs.
1. Bring all required power adapters, cables and converter/adapter plugs (if travelling from outside the USA).
1. Bring a USB drive in case you want to share something with a fellow MVP or back up your files and photos.
1. Bring a power bank to charge your phone during the long days and nights.
1. Bring business cards when networking with people.
1. Bring hand sanitizer. You will shake lots of hands and touch lots of doors.
1. Take a picture of your suitcase with your phone. If your bags don't arrive in Seattle, you can show the airline what they look like.
1. Take photos of your valuables and their serial numbers (laptop, tablet, etc.) in case they are lost/stolen.

## Travel
1. Make sure your passport is [valid for six months](https://www.immihelp.com/visas/six-months-passport-validity-rule-visitors.html) beyond the period of your intended stay.
1. Visit [U.S. Department of State's Visitor Visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html) to determine whether you need to obtain a visa to enter the United States.
1. Print and bring a copy of the Business Travel Support Letter available from the MVP Summit registration website. Even if you do not need a visa, it can smooth the way through U.S. Customs.
1. Print and bring a copy of the Executive Recognition Letter. This is the letter you get from Microsoft that you can send to employers mentioning you're an MVP. It's another item you can show to customs if needed. To create your letter, log into the MVP site and navigate to [MVP Content tab > Executive Recognition Letter](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Benefits/my-benefits-executive-recognition-letter).
1. Print copies of your travel itinerary including flights, hotel and shuttles. U.S. Customs will not appreciate it if you hold up the line while you flip through emails on your phone to find the information.
1. Make sure you have the street address of your MVP Summit hotel. You need this for your customs declaration form upon entry to the country.
1. Backup all travel information to a central store. DropBox, OneNote or Evernote makes this easy. You can also use the TripIt app on iOS and Android.


## Day-to-Day
1. Pack a travel coffee mug. MVPs waste a lot of paper cups over the three days of the summit. Having a reusable coffee mug can cut down on waste. It can also make grabbing a coffee before jumping on the busses so much easier.
1. Sticker swap: MVPs love stickers and there's usually a table dedicated to sticker swapping. Bring your stickers to share.
1. Watch Twitter and the [#MVPSummit](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23mvpsummit) hashtag for announcements on parties and get-togethers. There are usually parties each night. Some are country or product group specific and some are open to all. Keep your ear to the ground on social media.
1. RESPECT THE NDA. You will hear this a lot. Keep what you learn to yourself and do not share it with other MVPs or on social media.

## Miscellaneous
1. Have fun!
1. RESPECT THE NDA. (I said you hear this a lot.)
